# TODO: not automatable here. The reference answer is solution.SLDPRT
# (scores 8/8), but there is no headless way to "apply" a SolidWorks part
# inside a container -- SolidWorks has to actually open and rebuild the
# file through its own GUI/COM session.
#
# Locally on Windows this would look something like:
#   1. Open solution.SLDPRT in SolidWorks (or apply the edit by hand
#      starting from tests/task/prompt/input.SLDPRT)
#   2. Save as solution.SLDPRT
#   3. Run tests/task/harness/harness.py against it (or against the active
#      document)
